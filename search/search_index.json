After over 8 years of working on the first version of MeshCentral, work as moved to version 2 which this document described. In 2010, when MeshCentral v1 was first designed, the Internet was very different. HTML5 and WebSocket did not exists, no such thing as a software container, etc. With MeshCentral version 2, a complete redesign was made to make the software much more in line with modern Internet deployment models. </p> <p>The advent of NodeJS, WebSocket, WebRTC and other web technologies coming out in the last 10 years has really made the design of MeshCentral v2 not only possible, but quite amazing. Being able to use a single programming language across platforms to JavaScript. Being able to easily exchange objects using web socket and JSON, being able to scale with WebRTC, deploy quickly with containers, etc. Looking back at the incredible advances in web technologies lead to an almost mandatory MeshCentral redesign. </p>"},{"location":"design/#goals-requirements","title":"Goals &amp; Requirements","text":"<p>The goal of MeshCentral is to be the best open source remote management software in the world. Remote computer management is a big area with many different usages and requirements. To best suite this, it\u2019s important to have software that is as flexible as possible. Additionally, there are many other goals: </p> <ul> <li>Must be quick and easy to install. </li> <li>Must install on all major operating systems and platforms. </li> <li>Can be deployed on small computers and the cloud. </li> <li>Can be deployed within containers. </li> <li>Can be deployed in many network environments. </li> <li>Must support both software agent and Intel\u00ae AMT hardware agent. </li> <li>Must only use open source dependencies. </li> <li>Must provide all basic remote management features (desktop, terminal, files\u2026) </li> <li>Must use the network efficiently. </li> <li>Must have a real time user interface. </li> <li>Must be easy to use. </li> <li>Must be fast. </li> <li>Etc. </li> </ul> <p>Basically, all the requirements you would expect from open source software that can go viral. Since this software is sponsored by Intel, it\u2019s going to support Intel\u00ae AMT really well, making it possible to manage a remote computer regardless of its OS or power state. Intel\u00ae AMT is not required to use this software, however it\u2019s a great fit. </p>"},{"location":"design/#design-overview","title":"Design Overview","text":"<p>In this section, we do a very high level overview of MeshCentral\u2019s design. MeshCentral has 3 big components: the server, the agent and the web application. </p> <p></p> <p>There is of course more software that support these 3 components like the Windows Server Installer, ClickOnce application, MeshCentral Discovery Tool and more. These will be covered later. Most of the document will focus on these 3 main components. Another component that is significant but not part of the software itself is Intel\u00ae AMT (Intel\u00ae Active Management Technology). MeshCentral supports Intel AMT that acts like an optional hardware based agent for MeshCentral. </p> <p>When it comes to programming languages used, MeshCentral is mostly built with JavaScript with the agent having significant portable C code. This makes things pretty simple since the browser, server and agents can share some of the code. More importantly, JavaScript is great at parsing JSON and so, the main protocol used between the components is JSON over Web Socket. </p> <p></p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that while JavaScript is used in all 3 components, the JavaScript runtime is very different. The JavaScript written to run within a browser sandbox uses different calls than the one running in NodeJS on the server or on the agent with DukTape. </p> <p>This is probably a good time to introduce DukTape (https://www.duktape.org/). Unlike the browser and NodeJS JavaScript engines, DukTape is a less known JavaScript runtime written in C. The agent is built in C code with little smarts other than being able to securely connect back to the server. The server then pushes to the agent a JavaScript file that the agent runs. This makes the agent very flexible since a developers can quickly change the JavaScript that is pushed to the agent and change the agent\u2019s behavior instantly. </p> <p>Another interesting design decision is that MeshCentral makes almost no use of RESTful API\u2019s. Instead, almost everything is done using WebSocket. This allows JSON objects to be exchanged fully asynchronously. There is no pushing the refresh button or polling as events are sent by all actors in real time. </p>"},{"location":"design/#meshcentral-server","title":"MeshCentral server","text":"<p>The MeshCentral server is a NodeJS application that is published on NPM at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/meshcentral Many administrators can get started quickly using \u201cnpm install meshcentral\u201d once NodeJS is installed.

We wanted a way for the agent to connect to the server that would be similar to how browsers connect to web servers. This allows for a large number of agents to connect just like if a large number of browsers where connecting. All of the infrastructure that helps web server\u2019s scale would be put to use in the same way for agent connections. For example: TLS offload hardware, load balancers, reverse-proxies, web server scaling, etc. could all be put to use. It also makes the server easier to setup because only one port (HTTPS 443) is needed for both users and agents. </p> <p>One big difference between the agent connecting and a typical browser is how the server is authenticated. Browsers have a set of known trusted root certificates. The server\u2019s web certificate is checked for validity including the name, time trusted CA and more. The agent does not have this. Instead, it just has a hash to a private server certificate. </p> <p>The public facing web certificate of the server can change frequently. For example, Let\u2019s Encrypt certificates are valid 90 days. Agents need to be able to validate a specific server for a long time and don\u2019t really need to trust anything else except one specific server. We also don\u2019t want to tie the agents to a specific domain name as we could change that in the future or want to support servers with dynamic IP addresses and no fixed DNS names. </p> <p>To handle all this, the agent performs a TLS connection to the server and will first see the web certificate of the server. It will then exchange a set of web socket binary messages to the server to perform a secondary authentication with the server. </p> <p></p> <p>The secondary check allows the agent to confirm that this server does own the private key of the private certificate expected by the agent. The agent caches the hash of the \u201couter\u201d web certificate. When re-connecting, if the agent sees the same outer web certificate, it will skip the secondary check. For obvious security raisons, it\u2019s important that the agent not accept any management messages until the secondary check is completed or skipped. </p> <p>To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, the secondary check also \u201cpins\u201d the outer web certificate. That is, the server both confirms it\u2019s the right server and indicates to the agent the hash of the outer certificate that it must have seen during the TLS connection. The agent must check this hash to make sure there is no attacker in the middle. </p> <p>The agent connection design allows for reverse-proxies and TLS offload hardware. The agent will first connect a TLS session to the offload hardware. Clear traffic flows between the offload hardware and the server which will perform the secondary check if needed. </p> <p></p> <p>To makes all this work, the MeshCentral server must be able to fetch the hash of the outer web certificate from the reverse proxy. In this case, the server does not need the private key to the web certificate. Note that when the outer web certificate is updated, the server may have to perform many secondary checks at the same time causing a server slowdown during this time. To help with this, MeshCentral will offload the RSA signing operation to many slave processes (as many as the CPU core count on the server) to speed this up. In addition, native NodeJS RSA signing is used (not ForgeJS). </p> <p>The details of the secondary certificate check look like the diagram below. To boost speed, the exchange is fully asynchronous and both sides send the first message as soon as the TLS connection completes. </p> <p></p> <p>Note that these messages are binary (not JSON). The agent must be able to connect to the server independently of the JavaScript that is running in DukTape. So this exchange is handled by native C code in the agent. Binary message 1 is sent immediately after the TLS connection is setup. Both sides will send binary message 2 when message 1 is received and message 3 when message 2 is received. </p> <p>In addition, there are two extra messages of interest that can be sent by the agent right at the start. The agent may send the server message number 4 if the secondary check can be skipped and may send binary message number 5 indicating what server hash it expects to verify. Message number 5 is interesting because a server may have many \u201cidentities\u201d at the same time, and so, the server will use message number 5 in order to use the right Agent Server certificate. </p> <p>In order to be as secure as possible, all hashes use SHA384 and certificates are RSA3072 and nonces are generated on both sides using a cryptographic random source. The server and agent signatures are computed like this: </p> <p></p> <p>While the server will often skip its RSA signature operation due to the agents caching the outer web certificate, the server must perform an RSA verify to each agent connection. This can\u2019t be skipped but is needed to authenticate the agent. </p> <p>Once connected, the trust relationship between the server and the agent is one-way. That is, the server has management rights on the agent, but the agent does not have any right on the server. This is important since the agent does not, by default, have any credentials to the server. Any agent can connect to the server and claim to be part of a device group. </p>"},{"location":"design/#browser-to-agent-relay-and-webrtc","title":"Browser to agent relay and WebRTC","text":"<p>Browsers and agents often need to communicate to each other. Data sessions are used for desktop, terminal, file transfers, etc. and must be setup securely. </p> <p>To setup a session between a browser and the agent, the server will send a URL to both sides to connect to. The URL is generated by the server and includes a unique connection token. It is sent to both the browser and agent using the web socket control channel and a JSON message. Both sides perform a websocket connection to the target URL and the server will \u201cpipe\u201d both sessions together to act as a passive relay. For security, the agent will only accept connections to the URL given by the server if the server has the same outer web certificate as its control connection. Also note that in this mode, the session is not end-to-end encrypted. The server is performing a TLS decrypt and re-encrypt and the traffic cost is high as each byte of data has to be received and sent again. </p> <p></p> <p>The relay server is just websocket server that will wait for connections with session tokens. When two connection with the same connection token arrive, the server makes sure that at least one of the two connections is an authenticated user, it then sends the character \u201cc\u201d on both sides to inform both parties that the relay is starting and then pipes both sessions together. Once the session is started, the browser and agent are free to send messages to each other. Note that when the server sends the relay URL to the agent, it also sends to the agent the user\u2019s permissions flags. This may be used by the agent to limit what the user can do on this session. </p> <p>With this design, the flow control between the browser and agent is simple, each session gets its own end-to-end connection and the server will apply appropriate TCP back pressure on both sides as needed. </p> <p>A unique feature of MeshCentral is its use of WebRTC. WebRTC was introduced in major browsers as a way to allow browsers to directly communicate to each other and perform audio/video streaming. The mesh agent has a WebRTC data-only stack that is custom built for this project in C code. It\u2019s compatible with Chrome and Firefox implementations and once a session is set up, allows data to flow directly from the browser to the agent, bypassing the server. </p> <p></p> <p>The use of WebRTC allows MeshCentral to scale better, to offer a faster user experience and lower hosting costs all at the same time. However, WebRTC is not easy, especially when you must maintain the C code for it and have to keep up with browser implementations, but the benefits are clear. </p> <p>To setup WebRTC, browsers typically use STUN and TURN servers to get traffic thru any network obstacles (routers, proxies, firewalls). This infrastructure can be complex to setup especially if an administrator is not familiar with WebRTC concepts. To make things easy, MeshCentral opted to always start by using a websocket relay thru the server to get things started. While a session is active, the browser and agent will attempt to automatically switch the session traffic to WebRTC when possible. This way, the session always works and gets more efficient when network conditions allow. </p> <p>To perform the switch-over, both browser and agent will exchange WebRTC control messages over the newly established web socket relay session. </p> <p></p> <p>In order to differentiate session traffic from WebRTC control traffic, the browser and agent agree to send WebRTC setup traffic using web socket text fragments. All other session traffic is sent using binary fragments. The agent has a special API allowing a session to be piped for a single fragment type. So we can perform a remote desktop session to the agent while trying to setup WebRTC at the same time. </p> <p>The browser will kick off the WebRTC setup sending the initial WebRTC offer with the agent responding with a WebRTC answer. If the WebRTC session gets setup, both sides need to negotiate a clear transition from the web socket session to the WebRTC session. To do this, both sides send a start switch control fragment (this is a text fragment), the other side will respond with an ACK when the web socket session is flushed out and it\u2019s safe to switch. </p> <p>On the agent side, the new WebRTC session inherits the user access rights of the web socket. Currently, the web socket channel is still maintained open. While it\u2019s not strickly needed, the web socket session terminates more cleanly than WebRTC and so, oddly its closure is used to signal the end of the WebRTC session. </p>"},{"location":"design/#messenger","title":"Messenger","text":"<p>MeshCentral includes its own messaging web application it can be used to chat, transfer files and optionally used for audio and video chat. It\u2019s used to support two different usages: User-to-user and user-to-computer communication. In the first usage, two users that are connected to the same MeshCentral server at the same time can chat. If you are a MeshCentral administrator, you can see the list of currently logged in users and hit the chat button to launch a chat invitation. If accepted, the Messenger is open on both sides and the session starts. Alternatively, while managing a remote computer, an administrator can hit the chat button to cause the remote computer to open a web browser to the chat application. </p> <p></p> <p>The chat app is standalone web application that is served by the MeshCentral server using a connection token and title in the URL. Once loaded in its own web frame, the messenger web application will get the connection token and title from the URL and proceed to connect to the URL using web socket. The same web socket relay that is used for browser-to-agent connections is also used in this case for browser-to-browser connections. The server relay acts the same and pipes both sessions together after sending the character \u201cc\u201d to both sides. At this point, the messenger application will show the remote user as connected and chat and file transfers can start. File transfers are just a set of binary messages sent over the web socket session with lots of JSON control messages. </p> <p>Once the web socket session is setup, the messenger application will then attempt to perform a switch over to WebRTC. Both web application start by selecting a random number (not cryptographic) and the highest number will initiate the WebRTC offer. The other party will answer and both sides will trade interface candidates as they are discovered. If successful, the web socket session are flushed and the traffic is switched over to WebRTC. Because the switchover is done cleanly, it can occur while in the middle of a file transfer without the file being corrupted. </p> <p></p> <p>Finally, the web application will determine if the local computer is attached to a microphone and if it has a camera. If so, these options are offered in the chat window and audio/video chat is available for use. The chat app allows for one way setup of audio &amp; video sessions. This is typically what is needed in support scenarios where the audio/video session is one-way. </p> <p>The messenger web application will setup a separate WebRTC connection for audio/video in each direction but the code is present to augment the WebRTC control channel with audio/video which is a bit more efficient but more testing is needed before defaulting to this mode. </p>"},{"location":"design/#additional-resources","title":"Additional Resources","text":"<p>In addition to this document, there are a growing set of MeshCentral resources at: https://www.meshcommander.com/meshcentral2.

To do this, start by creating a new user called <code>meshcentral</code></p> <pre><code>sudo useradd -r -d /opt/meshcentral -s /sbin/nologin meshcentral\n</code></pre> <p>We can then create the installation folder, install and change permissions of the files so that the <code>meshcentral</code> account gets read-only access to the files.</p> <pre><code>sudo mkdir /opt/meshcentral\ncd /opt/meshcentral\nsudo npm install meshcentral\nsudo -u meshcentral node ./node_modules/meshcentral\n</code></pre> <p>The last line will run MeshCentral manually and allow it to install any missing modules and create the MeshCentral data folders. Once it\u2019s running, press CTRL-C and continue. The following two lines will change the ownership of files to the meshcentral user and restrict access to the files.</p> <pre><code>sudo chown -R meshcentral:meshcentral /opt/meshcentral\nsudo chmod 755 \u2013R /opt/meshcentral/meshcentral-*\n</code></pre> <p>To make this work, you will need to make MeshCentral work with MongoDB because the /meshcentral-data folder will be read-only. In addition, MeshCentral will not be able to update itself since the account does not have write access to the /node_modules files, so the update will have to be manual. First used systemctl to stop the MeshCentral server process, than use this:</p> <pre><code>cd /opt/meshcentral\nsudo npm install meshcentral\nsudo -u meshcentral node ./node_modules/meshcentral\nsudo chown -R meshcentral:meshcentral /opt/meshcentral\n</code></pre> <p>This will perform the update to the latest server on NPM and re-set the permissions so that the meshcentral user account has read-only access again. You can then use systemctl to make the server run again.</p> <p>MeshCentral allows users to upload and download files stores in the server\u2019s <code>meshcentral-files</code> folder. In an increased security setup, we still want the server to be able to read and write files to this folder and we can allow this with:</p> <pre><code>sudo chmod 755 \u2013R /opt/meshcentral/meshcentral-files\n</code></pre> <p>If you plan on using the increased security installation along with MeshCentral built-in Let\u2019s Encrypt support you will need to type the following commands to make the <code>letsencrypt</code> folder in <code>meshcentral-data</code> writable.</p> <pre><code>sudo mkdir /opt/meshcentral/meshcentral-data\nsudo mkdir /opt/meshcentral/meshcentral-data/letsencrypt\nsudo chmod 755 \u2013R /opt/meshcentral/meshcentral-data/letsencrypt\n</code></pre> <p>This will allow the server to get and periodically update its Let\u2019s Encrypt certificate.

Below is a list of settings that are available for the user. </p> Settings Option Description Cert Sets the DNS name of the server. If this name is not set, the server will run in \"LAN mode\". When set, the server\"s web certificate will use this name and the server will instruct agents and browsers to connect to that DNS name. You must set a server DNS name to run in \"WAN mode\". MeshCentral will not configure your DNS server. The DNS name must be configured separately. Port This sets the main web port used by the MeshCentral server and it\"s the same port that users and mesh agents will connect to. The default port is 443, but if the port is busy, the next available higher port is used (.e.g. 444) AliasPort Sets the main port that will be used by the server externally. By default is the same as \"Port\" above, but can be set to be different when next. See \"Server port aliasing\" section for more details. RedirPort This is the port for redirecting traffic in the web server. When the server is configured with HTTPS, users that uses HTTP will be redirected to HTTPS. Port 80 is the default port. So, redirection will happen from port 80 to port 443. MpsPort Port for Intel\" AMT Management Presence Server to receive Intel\" AMT CIRA (Client Initiated Remote Access) connections. The default is port 4433. This port is disabled in LAN mode. If user don\"t plan on using Intel\" AMT for management, this port can be left as-is. TLSOffload By default this option is set to \"false\". If set to \"true\", server will run both web port and the Intel AMT MPS port without TLS with the assumption that a TLS offloading is taking care of this task. For further details, see the \"TLS Offloading\" section. This option can also be set to the IP address of the reverse-proxy in order to indicate to MeshCental to only trust HTTP X-Forwarded headers coming from this IP address. See the \"Reverse-Proxy Setup\" section for an example. SelfUpdate When set to \"true\" the server will check for a new version and attempt to self-update automatically a bit after midnight local time every day. For this to work, the server needs to run with sufficient permissions to overwrite its own files. If you run the server with more secure, restricted privileges, this option should not be used. If set to a specific version such as \"0.2.7-g\" when the server will immediately update to the specified version on startup if it\"s not already at this version. SessionKey This is the encryption key used to secure the user\"s login session. It will encrypt the browser cookie. By default, this value is randomly generated each time the server starts. If many servers are used with a load balancer, all servers should use the same session key. In addition, one can set this key so that when the server restarts, users do not need to re-login to the server. Minify Default value is 0, when set to 1 the server will serve \"minified\" web pages, that is, web pages that have all comments, white spaces and other unused characters removed. This reduces the data size of the web pages by about half and reduced the number requests made by the browser. The source code of the web page will not be easily readable, adding \"&amp;nominify=1\" at the end of the URL will override this option. User Specify a username that browsers will be automatically logged in as. Useful to skip the login page and password prompts. Used heavily during development of MeshCentral. NoUsers By default this option is \"false\" and if set to \"true\", server will only accept users from localhost (127.0.0.1) and will not have a login page. Instead, a single user is always logged in. This mode is useful if user opts to setup MeshCentral as a local tool instead of as a multi-user server MpsCert Specifies the official name of the Intel AMT MPS server. If not specified, this is the same as the official server name specified by \"cert\". This option is generally used with MPS aliasing, see the \"Server port aliasing\" section for more information. MpsAliasPort Specify an alias port for the MPS server. See the section on \"Server port aliasing\" for use of this option. ExactPorts If this option is set to \"true\", only the exact port will be used. By default, if a port is in use, the server will try to bind the next available higher port. This is true for the \"port\", \"redirport\" and \"mpsport\" settings. Lanonly Server\"s default mode if not set with \"--cert\" option. If this option is set to \"true\", Intel\" AMT MPS will be disabled, server name and fixed IP option will be hidden. Mesh agents will search for the server using multicast on the network. Wanonly A recommended option when running MeshCentral in the cloud. If set to \"true\", server will run as a cloud service and assumes LAN features are disabled. For this option to work, the server must have a fixed IP or DNS record using the \"--cert\"\" option. In this mode, LAN discovery features are disabled. AllowFraming By default is set to \"false\". If set to \"true\", web pages will be served in a way that allows them to be placed within an iframe of another web page. This is useful when you wish to add MeshCentral features into another website. AllowLoginToken By default is set to \"false\". If set to \"true\", the server allows login tokens to be used in the URL as a replacement for user login. This is useful along with \"allowFraming\" option to embed MeshCentral features into another website. MongoDB Used to specify the MongoDB connection string. If not specified, MeshCentral will use the NeDB database with the file meshcentral.db in the meshcentral-data folder. To setup MongoDB, please refer to the Database section of this document. MongoDBCol Used to specify the MongoDB collection name in the database. By default this value is \"meshcentral\". See Database section for more details on MongoDB setup. DbEncryptKey Specifies a password used to encrypt the database when NeDB is in use. If wanting to encrypt an existing database, use the \"dbexport\" and \"dbimport\" to save and reload the database with the encryption password set. WebRTC Set to \"true\" or \"false\" depending if you want to allow the server to setup WebRTC communication. If WebRTC is setup, management traffic will flow directly between the browser and mesh agent, bypassing the server completely. The default is false now, but will be switched to true when WebRTC is ready for production. ClickOnce Set to \"true\" or \"false\" to allow or disallow browser ClickOnce features. When enabled, browsers running on Windows will be shown extra options to allow RDP and other sessions thru the MeshCentral server. This requires ClickOnce browser support that is built-in to IE and available as add-in to Chrome and Firefox. Default is true. <p>Important</p> <p>Changes in config.json will NOT take effect until server is restarted. </p> <p>Note: We recommend the user to use a non-production server to experiment the setting options above.  </p>"},{"location":"meshcentral/#domains","title":"Domains","text":"<p>In the domains section, you can set options for the default domain (\"\") in addition to creating new domains to establish a multi-tenancy server. For standard configuration, the root domain and other domains will be accessible like this:</p> <p>https://servername:8080/            &lt;- default domain</p> <p>https://servername:8080/customer1       &lt;- customer1 domain</p> <p>https://servername:8080/customer2       &lt;- customer2 domain</p> <p>When a user setup many domains, the server considers each domain separately and each domain has separate user accounts, administrators, etc. If a domain has no users, the first created account will be administrator for that domain. Each domain has sub-settings as follows:</p> Sub Settings Description Title &amp; Title2 This are the strings that will be displayed at the banner of the website. By default title is set to \u201cMeshCentral\u201d and title2 is set to a version number UserQuota This is the maximum amount of data in kilobytes that can be placed in the \u201cMy Files\u201d tab for a user account. MeshQuota This is the maximum amount of data in kilobytes that can be placed in the \u201cMy Files\u201d tab for a given mesh NewAccounts If set to zero (0) UserAllowedIP Allows user to set a list of allowed IP addresses. See section on server IP filtering. Auth This mode is often used in corporate environments. When server is running on Windows and this value is set to \u201csspi\u201d, domain control authentication to the website is performed. In this mode, no login screen is displayed and browser will authenticate using the user\u2019s domain credentials. Dns The DNS record for this domain. If specified, the domain is accessed using a DNS record like \u201ccustomer1.servername.com\u201d instead of \u201cservername/customer1\u201d. This feature requires the DNS server to be configured to point this server with a valid DNS record. CertUrl Load the TLS certificate for this domain from this https url. For example \u201chttps://127.0.0.1:123\u201d. This option is useful when used along with the \u201cTlsOffload\u201d option. When MeshCentral is not doing any TLS but has a reverse-proxy or TLS offload device doing this work in front of the server, you can use this to have MeshCentral load the certificate from the server in front of MeshCentral.This is needed because when agents connect, they need to be told that the certificate they saw upon connecting is the correct one. Using this, MeshCentral will know what certificate the agents are expected to see. PasswordRequirements Used to specify the minimum password requirements for user authentication to this domain. By default, no password requirements are enforced but the user will see a password strength indicator that is not backed by any verifiable data.The value must be set to an object, for example:<code>{ \"\"min\"\": 8, \"\"max\"\": 128, \"\"upper\"\": 1, \"\"lower\"\": 1, \"\"numeric\"\": 1, \"\"nonalpha\"\": 1 }</code>This indicated that passwords must be at least 8 characters long and have at least one upper case, one lower case, one numeric and one non-alphanumeric character. You can also set the maximum length of the password, however MeshCentral has already a limit of 256 characters. Specifying anything above this will have no effect.Note that password requirements for Intel\u00ae AMT are defined by Intel and so, Intel\u00ae AMT passwords will always be verified using a separate set of requirements. <p>Note: When the DNS value is set for a domain, user can\u2019t access the domain using \u201cservername/customer1\u201d instead it must be accessed with the valid DNS record and the DNS server should be setup to have two or more DNS records pointing to the same IP address.</p> <p>In this mode, the server will serve a different TLS certificate depending on what DNS record is used to access the server.</p> <p></p> <p>As shown in the example above, we have two names that point to the same IP address. Since the configuration specifies the \u201cdns\u201d value, the second domain is only shown when the right name is used. We use \u201cmeshcentral\u201d and \u201cdevbox\u201d for DNS names, but in practice the user will use fully qualified domain names (FQDN) like \u201cmeshcentral.com\u201d or \u201cdevbox.meshcentral.com\u201d.</p>"},{"location":"meshcentral/#server-peering","title":"Server Peering","text":"<p>MeshCentral supports server peering.

There are some limitations and so, it\u2019s best to get familiar with this service before starting. You will also need a valid domain name that you own and that points to your MeshCentral server.</p> <p></p> <p>Before moving forward with this section, make sure your MeshCentral server is working correctly, has a domain name pointing to it and that the HTTP redirection server on port 80 is enabled and working. MeshCentral\u2019s HTTP port 80 server will be used in the process to prove to Let\u2019s Encrypt that we have control over the domain. At any point, you may try to use https://letsdebug.net/ to see if your domain is setup correctly and/or debug any issues. When ready, add the \u201cletsencrypt\u201d section to the config.json file like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n\"settings\": {\n\"RedirPort\": 80,\n},\n\"letsencrypt\": {\n\"email\": \"myemail@myserver.com\",\n\"names\": \"domain1.com,domain2.com\",\n\"rsaKeySize\": 3072,\n\"production\": false\n},\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The only mandatory field is the email address, please enter a valid one.</p> <p>The names section is a list of domain names the requested certificate will be valid for. This must be a list of DNS names that are already pointing to your server. It\u2019s important to understand you are not requesting these DNS names, rather, Let\u2019s Encrypt will makes requests to prove control over all of these domain name before issuing the certificate. All the domain names you enter must point to the server and HTTP port 80 must be reachable over the internet. If you don\u2019t specify names, the default MeshCentral certificate name is used, that is the configured \u201c--cert [name]\u201d.</p> <p>The RSA key size can only be 2048 or 3072, with the default being 3072.

You should get a real certificate in a few minutes to a few hours. MeshCentral will automatically renew the certificate a few days before it expires. The MeshCentral self-signed certificate will still be present in the \u201cmeshcentral-data\u201d folder, this is normal and there is no need to manually copy the Let\u2019s Encrypt certificate to the \u201cmeshcentral-data\u201d folder.

So, even if the server privately uses non-standard ports, the public ports are the standard ports 80 and 443. You have to tell MeshCentral to bind to private ports but pretend it\u2019s using the other standard ports when communicating publicly. To make this work, MeshCentral supports port aliasing.</p> <p>For example you can run:</p> <pre><code>    node meshcentral --redirport 2001 --port 2002 --aliasport 443\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Here, the server binds the HTTP and HTTPS ports to 2001 and 2002, but the server will externally indicate to MeshAgents and browsers that they must connect to port 443.</p> <p>In a different situation, you may want to setup a server so that both Mesh Agents and Intel AMT connect back to the server on port 443.

This is useful if you need to host many services on a single public IP address, if you want to offload TLS and perform extra web caching. In this section we will setup NGINX, a popular reverse-proxy, in front of MeshCentral. NGNIX is available at: https://www.nginx.com/</p> <p></p> <p>In this example, we will:</p> <ul> <li>MeshCentral on non-standard ports, but alias HTTPS to port 443.</li> <li>NGINX will be using standard ports 80 and 443.</li> <li>We will have NGINX perform all TLS authentication &amp; encryption.</li> <li>MeshCentral will read the NGINX web certificate so agents will perform correct server authentication.</li> <li>NGINX will be setup with long timeouts, because agents have long standard web socket connections.</li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s get started by configuring MeshCentral with the following values in config.json:</p> <pre><code>{\n\"settings\": {\n\"Cert\": \"myservername.domain.com\",\n\"Port\": 4430,\n\"AliasPort\": 443,\n\"RedirPort\": 800,\n\"AgentPong\": 300,\n\"TlsOffload\": \"127.0.0.1\"\n},\n\"domains\": {\n\"\": {\n\"certUrl\": \"https://127.0.0.1:443/\"\n}\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>With this configuration, MeshCentral will be using port 4430 instead of port 443, but because \u201cTlsOffload\u201d is set, TLS will not be performed on port 4430. The server name is set to \u201cmyservername.domain.com\u201d, so that is the name that MeshCentral will give to agents to connect to. Also, the alias port is set to 443. So agents will be told to connect to \u201cmyservername.domain.com:443\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201cAgentPong\u201d line instructs the server to send data to the agent each 300 seconds and the agent by default will send data to the server every 120 seconds. As long as NGINX timeouts are longer than this, connections should remain open.</p> <p>When agents connect, they will see the NGINX TLS certificate on port 443. MeshCentral needs to know about the NGINX certificate so that it can tell the agents this is the correct certificate they should expect to see. So, \u201ccertUrl\u201d is used to tell MeshCentral where to get the certificates that agents will see when connecting.</p> <p>When NGINX forwards connections to MeshCentral, extra X-Forwarded headers will be added to each request. MeshCentral needs to know if these headers can be trusted or not. By setting \u201cTlsOffload\u201d to \u201c127.0.0.1\u201d, MeshCentral is told to trust these headers when requests come from \u201c127.0.0.1\u201d.</p> <p>In this example, make sure to change \u201c127.0.0.1\u201d to the IP address of NGINX and \u201cCert\u201d to the external DNS name of the NGINX server.</p> <p>Next, we need to configure and launch NGINX. Here is an ngnix.conf to get started:</p> <pre><code>worker_processes 1;\n\nevents {\n    worker_connections 1024;\n}\n\nhttp {\n    # HTTP server.

We forward HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443 to the corresponding ports on MeshCentral. In this example, we happen to use the web certificates that where generated by MeshCentral, but any certificate is ok. We also add extra \u201cX-Forward\u201d headers, this tells MeshCentral information that would normally be hidden by NGINX, like the client\u2019s IP address and more.</p> <p>Now we are ready to start NGINX and MeshCentral. You should start NGINX first because MeshCentral will try to fetch the certificate from NGINX upon start. When starting MeshCentral, you should see something like this:</p> <pre><code>MeshCentral HTTP redirection web server running on port 800.\nLoaded RSA web certificate at https://127.0.0.1:443/, SHA384: d9de9e27a229b5355708a3672fb23237cc994a680b3570d242a91e36b4ae5bc96539e59746e2b71eef3dbdabbf2ae138.\nMeshCentral Intel(R) AMT server running on myservername.domain.com:4433.\nMeshCentral HTTP web server running on port 4430, alias port 443.\n</code></pre> <p>Notice on the second line, MeshCentral will have loaded the web certificate from NGNIX and display a matching hash.

It\u2019s critical that the content of meshcentral-data be backed up in a secure location and preferably using encryption, this is because it contains certificates that give this server its unique personality. Once agents are installed, they will only connect to this server and no other. If you reinstall MeshCentral, even if it is with the same domain name, agents will not connect to the new server since the server certificates are different. Also, someone with access to a backup of \u201cmeshcentral-data\u201d could impersonate the server.\n\nTo restore back backup, just install a MeshCentral server, make sure it works correctly. Stop it, wipe the old \u201cmeshcentral-data\u201d and \u201cmeshcentral-files\u201d and put the backup version instead. If using MongoDB, copy the backup.archive back, make sure to clean up any existing \u201cmeshcentral\u201d database, run \u201cmongo\u201d and type:\n</code></pre> use meshcentral db.dropDatabase() <pre><code>Then exit with Ctrl-C and run:\n</code></pre> mongorestore --archive=backup.archive <pre><code>This will re-import the database from the backup.

On Linux* you can use NPM directly (\u201cnpm install meshcentral\u201d) and on Windows you can use the .MSI installer.</li> <li>Cross-Platform Support \u2013 Contrary to MeshCentral1 that only runs on Windows*, MeshCentral can run on any environment that supports NodeJS. This includes Windows*, Linux* and OSX*. Because MeshCentral runs on Linux, it often lowers hosting costs and makes it possible to run MeshCentral in a Docker* container environment.</li> <li>Runs with Little Compute Resources \u2013 Typical MeshCentral1 installation requires a large disk space foot print (approx* 30G of disk space) and is compute intensive even for small deployments. MeshCentral requires little resources to host (70MB) and able to deliver reasonable performance on a 900Mhz CPU with 1GB RAM. </li> <li>Multi-Tenancy  and Load Balancing Support \u2013 MeshCentral can handle hosting many server instances at once. Each instance or \u201cdomain\u201d has it\u2019s own administrators, users and computers to manage. The server can handle each instance using a url path \u201cserver.com/customer1\u201d or a DNS name \u201ccustomer1.server.com\u201d. Many customers can be handled by having all the DNS names point to the same server IP address. MeshCentral will take care of serving the right TLS certificate for each connection.</li> <li>Single Executable \u2013 MeshCentral is a single-module or single executable server. All of the components of MeshCentral1 including IIS, Swarm, AJAX, Social, Manageability Servers are all build into one single executable. This makes it super easy to setup and run, it also minimizes problems and overhead caused by having many components communicate to each other. When the server is updated, all of the components are updated at once and effective.</li> <li>Web Application Design \u2013 MeshCentral1 has 100\u2019s of web pages and often times a click on a web page causes the browser to load a different web page and this creates more load on the server. With MeshCentral there are only two main web pages: The login page and the main web application. This design is much more responsive since the server now delegates most of the UI workload to the client\u2019s web browser.</li> <li>Real-Time User Interface \u2013 In MeshCentral, the user never has to hit the \u201crefresh\u201d button to update the web page. The web interface is completely real-time and updates as things change. MeshCentral uses websockets to connect to the server and get real-time events.</li> <li>Single Programming Language \u2013 MeshCentral1 used JavaScript on the browser, C# on the server and C for the agent. Use of 3 different programming languages means that developers wanting to implement a new use-case needs to have sufficient skills to change between these 3 languages during the coding session. Makes the code significantly more difficult to understand and maintain.</li> <li>Support for LAN only Mode \u2013 MeshCentral is capable of being setup as \u201cLAN only\u201d mode. In fact, this is the default mode when no static name or IP address is provided. In this mode, MeshAgents perform a multicast search on the network for the server making a static DNS/IP unnecessary.</li> <li>Support for TLS Offloaders \u2013 TLS offloaders are now fully supported. This means that MeshCentral can handle way more network connections and traffic significantly.</li> <li>Support for CIRA User/Pass Login \u2013 MeshCentral now supports both Intel AMT CIRA user/pass login and certificate login. Compared to MeshCentral1 that only supported certificate login, user/pass login is easier to setup and it can also be used for TLS offloaders and CIRA authentication. </li> <li>No Live State Stored in the Database \u2013 One if the big problems with MeshCentral1 is that a lot of the live states (Agent, User and AMT connections and disconnections) needed to be stored in the database. This caused a few problems, first the extra load on the database that was un-necessary, but also that servers did not have real-time state information about other servers (they had to query the database). This resulted in more load on the database and scaling issues. In MeshCentral, all live states are kept in the RAM which boosts performance significantly.</li> <li>Agentless Intel AMT Support \u2013 With MeshCentral1, administrators have to install the MeshAgent software on all computers, even if it was only for used for Intel AMT. MeshCentral supports a new agent-less mesh type that allows administrators to just setup the server strictly for Intel AMT only.</li> <li>Latest Security &amp; Crypto algorithms \u2013 MeshCentral uses all the latest cryptographic algorithm, notably SHA384 and RSA3072 making it more resistant to future quantum computer attacks. This would be very difficult to retrofit into MeshCentralv1 since it would require change of database schema and 1000\u2019s of line of code thus making the server incompatible with the current version version, making migration difficult.</li> <li>Support for Email Verification and Password Recovery \u2013 MeshCentral can be configured with an SMTP server to send out e-mail confirmation messages and password recovery message. This is an important feature that was missing in MeshCentral1.</li> <li>MeshInterceptor Support \u2013 MeshCentral can insert HTTP and Intel AMT redirection credential into a live data stream. This is useful to allow an administrator to securely pass Intel AMT password and control over an Intel AMT computer via web browser without the additional administrator login UI.</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s possible to perform migration to MeshCentral from MeshCentral1 server using a migration package. The MeshCentral Migration Tool will convert your existing user database into a format that can be imported into MeshCentral.</p> <p></p> <p>In addition to the migration tool, MeshCentral has a special module that will update all MeshAgents from v1 to v2 so the transition should be simple.</p>"},{"location":"meshcentral/#additional-resources","title":"Additional Resources","text":"<p>In addition to this document, there are a growing set of MeshCentral tutorial videos available on YouTube which covers all of the basic at www.meshcommander.com/meshcentral2/tutorials.

TCP port mapping works by selecting a port on your local computer that will be routed to a remote device and port. Here, local port 123 is routed thru the server to port 123 on a remote device. </p> <p></p> <p>Of course, this picture is a bit simplify. Firewalls, NAT routers and HTTP proxies may be in the way and the MeshAgent on the remote computer will act at the TCP traffic relay in most cases. </p> <p>One typical use of this is to route local port 1234 to port Microsoft RDP port 3389 on a remote device. Once routed, you can start a RDP session on \u201clocalhost:1234\u201d and get a RDP session to the remote device.

The \"How to Create a Discord Bot Account\" section will show how to create a bot and get the token, the \"How to Invite Your Bot to Join a Server\" section shows how to join the bot to a Discord server.</p> <p>Note that Privleged Gateway Intents permissions is needed for the bot on Discord. If not set, MeshCentral will show an error when trying to connect to Discord.</p> <p></p> <p>Discord integration requires that MeshCentral be run on NodeJS v17 or higher. Once you have the Discord bot login token, the config.json Discord configuration looks like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n\"messaging\": {\n\"discord\": {\n\"serverurl\": \"https://discord.gg/xxxxxxxxx\",\n\"token\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\n}\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Once users will need to join the same Discord server as the bot, the optional \"serverurl\" can be used to give the users a URL link to join the server, this can be a server invitation link or some other URL with instructions.</p>"},{"location":"messaging/#xmpp-setup","title":"XMPP Setup","text":"<p>For XMPP integration, you need to provide MeshCentral with a XMPP server, username and password so that MeshCentral can login and send notifications to users.
